# OWU-Ollama-Langsmith-Pipeline
OpenWebUI Pipeline for Ollama to sending tracing information to LangSmith.

## About:
- I made this repo to help with commit history, version control, and seak additional help.

## Known Issues:
As of the 12th of the December, 2024, this code is not fully working, and sends more traces than it should, and the traces sent are only the "header" of the chats for some reason
